# wifi-audit_pind

This is my node.js server and arduino code for Physical Interfaces and Network Devices course. It inclides my midterm project: wifi-audit. 

The arduino code (in arduino_only directory) is included in the repository because its part of the project but is meant to be loaded directly onto a Adafruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266 Microcontroller.
