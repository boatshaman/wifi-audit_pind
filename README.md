# wifi-audit_pind

This is my node.js server and arduino code for my wifi-auditor. It is a battery powered IoT device which will brute-force wifi passwords and upload them to a server which displays the SSID + password on a map. It is meant to bring visibility to insecure wifi passwords. 

The arduino code (in arduino_only directory) is included in the repository because its part of the project but is meant to be loaded directly onto a Adafruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266 Microcontroller.
